My name is Salme Cook and I am using this platform to build a portfolio of written motivation behind my research. 

This was inspired by a blog that my co-worker Taran (singhscorner-blog) started to share his thoughts and tools surrounding hydrodynamic modeling and High Performance Compputing (HPC). The blog's purpose is to document the background behind the science in a journal-like format, more than a methods based scientific article. I find I lose a lot of creativity with scientific writing and I hope to gain some of that back through this medium.

My background is:
*  Research Oceanographer (PostDoc) with the US Geological Survey in Woods Hole, MA, USA. 
*  B.E. in Environmental Engineering, M.E. in Ocean Engineering, from Stevens Institute of Technology  and PhD in Oceanography from University of New Hampshire

In my free time as a human I love soccer and running, being outside in any capacity (gardening, hiking, camping), and hanging out with my partner Mike, and dog Nanook.
